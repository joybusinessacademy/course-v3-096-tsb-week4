        <p>The fifth of Coach Mark's Great Eight is about your personal development. Your biggest asset is you. You are only as good as your mind provides.</p>
        <p>Get coaching, mentoring and even meetings with people who are successful in your game. Create a learning hour where you read, watch and listen to experts and commentators on business and performance. Use Ted Talks, YouTube and read books. Grow yourself, and you grow your business.
