            The worst – and I mean the worst – statement that I ever hear is when people say, “We have to get back to the basics.”

            I despair when I hear a national sports coach say they need to get back to the basics. My question to them is, “Why did you ever leave the basics?”

            The basics work, so stick to them. Now and then they need a tweak; very rarely do they need a significant overhaul.
