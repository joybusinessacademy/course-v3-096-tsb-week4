        In your business, there will be core activities that drive your business success. These activities will be the basics that eventually help you grow your business â€“ things such as prospecting, administration, following up leads, coaching staff, communicating with customers and managing your database to name a few. Make sure these primary activities don't get compromised. Always maintain a high standard with them: they are the core foundation of your business.
