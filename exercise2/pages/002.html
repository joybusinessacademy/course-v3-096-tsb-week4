            The first of Coach Mark's Great Eight is about switching on. It’s about knowing your people, your business, your market and your industry better than anyone else.

        <p>
            Switching on means putting things in front of mind. It means becoming a student of the game. The things you need to know about, and what you need to know about them, are always right in front of your face – you don’t see them until you switch on.
