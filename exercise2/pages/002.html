        <p><em>“For many years I have studied close up the attitude of successful people.  I have been fortunate to be surrounded by highly-motivated, successful people for much of my adult life. When it came to identifying the traits of these individuals I took many pages of notes on my observations. </em></p>
        <p><em>I observed athletes and business people alike who were at the top of their game. What I lacked was a simple way of capturing these traits. Out of the blue one day, I decided to use the letters of the word Attitude to simplify my notes.”</em>
